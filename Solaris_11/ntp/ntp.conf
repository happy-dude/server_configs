# Since in general, all NTP servers can be NTP clients and vice
# versa, all of the information in the /etc/inet/ntp.client file
# applies to NTP server setup as well. However, a certain kind
# NTP server, called a Stratum 1 server, has one or more devices
# designed to provide very accurate time to the server. These 
# devices are configured using the "server" keyword, just as the
# servers used by the client are, but instead of a hostname or 
# IP address, a format resembling an IP address is used. The first
# two octets of "127.127" are used to designate that this 
# line is referring to a clock and not an network NTP server. 
# The next octet is used to designate which type of device is used. 
# And the last octet is used to specify a unit number if more than
# one is used. Notice that the resulting number looks like the 
# localhost address, it is not the same. The real localhost
# address (127.0.0.1) does not have the second octet of 127 as
# the hardware clock designator does.

# While all the current refclock drivers are configured and compiled,
# not all the actual hardware can be supported on all systems. The
# gpsvme driver can only be expected to work on systems with a VME 
# bus. The WWV audio driver can only be used on systems with audio
# input. 
#  
# In general, refclock type 1, the LOCAL clock is not necessary and
# should not be configured. It should only be used when either there
# is some other process being used to synchronize the clock, such as
# with hardware with vendor provided drivers, or when it is desired
# that a server without access to a real NTP time source needs to 
# act as a multicast or broadcast server. The LOCAL clock should not
# be configured as a "backup" to other external servers. 

# Some of the devices have tuning parameters, called "fudge" factors, 
# that can be set on the server line.  See the ntpd documentation.

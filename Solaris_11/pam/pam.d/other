# pam_tsol_account(5) returns PAM_IGNORE if the system is not configured
# with Trusted Extensions (TX) enabled.  In TX environments some PAM services
# run in the Trusted Path where pam_tsol_account(5) isn't applicable so in
# those cases, like gdm(1m) or xscreensaver(1), PAM stacks are delivered
# in /etc/pam.d which exclude pam_tsol_account(5).  pam_tsol_account(5) does
# need to run in the Trusted Path for ensuring remote hosts connecting to the
# global zone have a CIPSO host type.
